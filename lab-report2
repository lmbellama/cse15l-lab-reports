Part 1:

String Server Code:

Example 1:

The methods that are called are the main method in the StringServer class, which calls the handleRequest() method. The handleRequest() method has an argument for a URI and has two fields, int num which is 0 and a string called message that is null. Both of the values in those two feilds change when this request is made. The num integer gets incremented by one and the message is changed to include the new line.

Example 2:

The methods that were called were the same as before, the main method from the StringServer class and the handleRequest() method in the Handler class. The arguments in the main method are the commands from the command line. And the arguments for the handleRequest() method is a URI. The feilds for the handleRequest() method are an integer called n and a string called message. Initially, n is equal to 1 and message is "1. hi", and after the command n equals 2 and message is "1. hi" + "/n" +  "2.how was your day?".

Something that I learned about this week that I didn't know about before are port numbers. Servers can have multiple ports and port numbers are used to identify different ports. There are two ports, 80 and 443, that are commonly used on the web.
