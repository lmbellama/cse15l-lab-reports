Step 4: Logging into ieng6

To log into ieng6, after I made sure that the terminal was using bash, I entered "ssh cs15lfa23kw@ieng6.ucsd.edu" into the terminal

Step 5: Cloning the fork from Github

After I had already copied the ssh URL from github, I typed "git clone" and hit <Ctrl> + v in order to paste the URL into the terminal. 

Step 6: Running the tests

To run the tests in the ListExamplesTests.java I pasted "javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar" using <ctrl> + <v> into the terminal and typed "ListExamplesTests.java" and hit <enter>. I also pasted "java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore" into the terminal using the same keys as before and typed "ListExamplesTests" and hit <enter>.

To edit the "ListExamples.java" file, I typed "vim ListExamples.java" into the terminal and hit <enter>. I hit <j> 37 times to move down to the line I wanted to edit. To make the edit, I pressed <h> 6 times to move the curser over the "1" in "index1", and pressed <x>, <i>, then 2, to delete the 1 and write the 2. Lastly, I saved and closed the file by pressing <esc> and typing":wq".
